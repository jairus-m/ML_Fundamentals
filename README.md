# ML_Fundamentals

The goal:
  - Explore/understand the mathematics behind ML
  - Gain a depper intuition how ML models function in practice
  - Build ML models using NUMPY in order to build them without blackbox abstractions
  - Utilize abstracted frameworks/libraries like Scikit Learn/Tensorflow/PyTorch to implement ML to practical problems
