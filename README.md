# ML_Fundamentals

Goals:
  - Explore/understand the mathematics behind ML
  - Gain a deepper intuition on how ML models function 
  - Build ML models using NUMPY in order to build them from the ground-up (without blackbox abstractions)
  - Utilize frameworks/libraries like Scikit Learn/Tensorflow/PyTorch to implement ML to practical problems
