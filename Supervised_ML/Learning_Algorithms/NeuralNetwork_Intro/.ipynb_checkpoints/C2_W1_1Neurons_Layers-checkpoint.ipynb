    "# Optional Lab - Neurons and Layers\n",
    "In this lab we will explore the inner workings of neurons/units and layers. In particular, the lab will draw parallels to the models you have mastered in Course 1, the regression/linear model and the logistic model. The lab will introduce Tensorflow and demonstrate how these models are implemented in that framework.\n",

    "Tensorflow is a machine learning package developed by Google. In 2019, Google integrated Keras into Tensorflow and released Tensorflow 2.0. Keras is a framework developed independently by Fran√ßois Chollet that creates a simple, layer-centric interface to Tensorflow. This course will be using the Keras interface. "
